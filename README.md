- Download the autograder from GitHub: `https://github.com/CSE546-Cloud-Computing/CSE546-SPRING-2026.git`
  - In order to clone the GitHub repository follow the below steps:
  - `git clone https://github.com/CSE546-Cloud-Computing/CSE546-SPRING-2026.git` 
  - `cd CSE546-SPRING-2026/`
  - `git checkout project-0`
- Create a directory `submissions` in the CSE546-SPRING-2026 directory and move your zip file to the submissions directory.

  - Validate if the zip file adheres to the submission guidelines as mentioned in the project document.
    - If Yes; proceed to next step
